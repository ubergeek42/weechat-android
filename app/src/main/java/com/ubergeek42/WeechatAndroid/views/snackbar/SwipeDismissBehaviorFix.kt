/**
 * This exists to help Snackbars actually move on the screen when you try to swipe them away.
 * With the default SwipeDismissBehavior, while you can can dismiss them by flinging,
 * they stay in place while you do so, and only ever disappear to the right,
 * not into the direction of the fling. The library provides the functionality, it's just broken.
 *
 * The issue is, when we get a move event, ViewDragHelper will capture the view for dragging,
 * and ask parent to stop intercepting further touches. This propagates to CoordinatorLayout,
 * which then resets touch behavior for its children--including us.
 *
 * The sequence of unfortunate events:
 *   * [onInterceptTouchEvent]
 *   * [ViewDragHelper.shouldInterceptTouchEvent]
 *   * [ViewDragHelper.tryCaptureViewForDrag]
 *   * [ViewDragHelper.captureChildView]
 *   * [ViewDragHelper.Callback.onViewCaptured]
 *   * [CoordinatorLayout.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent]
 *   * [CoordinatorLayout.resetTouchBehaviors]
 *   * [onTouchEvent]
 *
 * This fix solves the issue in a very simple way, by ignoring calls to [onTouchEvent]
 * during the call to [onInterceptTouchEvent].
 *
 * Note that this fix is currently used for [SensibleSwipeDismissBehavior],
 * but is applicable to [SwipeDismissBehavior] as well.
